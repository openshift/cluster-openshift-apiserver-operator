# NetworkPolicy for openshift-apiserver operand pods in the openshift-apiserver namespace.
#
# Unlike kube-apiserver and etcd, the openshift-apiserver pods run on the pod network
# (they do NOT use hostNetwork: true), so NetworkPolicy applies to them.
---
# Default-deny policy for the openshift-apiserver namespace.
# This policy selects all pods in the namespace and enables default-deny for both
# ingress and egress by specifying policyTypes without any allow rules.
#
# NetworkPolicies are additive (use OR logic):
# - This policy enables default-deny for all pods
# - Subsequent policies add specific allow rules
# - If any policy allows traffic, that traffic is permitted
# - Policies cannot override or block traffic allowed by other policies
#
# Without this policy, all pods would have unrestricted network access (allow-all).
