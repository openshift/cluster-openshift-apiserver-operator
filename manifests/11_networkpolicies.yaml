# Default-deny policy for the openshift-apiserver-operator namespace.
# This policy selects all pods in the namespace and enables default-deny for both
# ingress and egress by specifying policyTypes without any allow rules.
#
# NetworkPolicies are additive (use OR logic):
# - This policy enables default-deny for all pods
# - Subsequent policies add specific allow rules
# - If any policy allows traffic, that traffic is permitted
# - Policies cannot override or block traffic allowed by other policies
#
# Without this policy, all pods would have unrestricted network access (allow-all).

# Allow egress to the Kubernetes API server.
# The openshift-apiserver-operator needs to communicate with the API server to:
# - Watch and update openshift-apiserver resources
# - Manage pods, services, and other resources in the openshift-apiserver namespace
# - Update cluster operator status
# - Watch nodes and other cluster resources
#
# Note: We allow all egress because the API server IP address and port can vary
# depending on cluster configuration (external load balancer, internal service, etc.).
